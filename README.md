## 1. Instructions

1. This is a **group work** (3–5 students per group).
   - Groups must already be formed.
   - Working with anyone outside the group is considered **cheating** and will receive **zero marks**.
   - Copying from any sources will receive **zero marks**.
   - Individual submission will receive **zero marks**.
   - If you have issues finding group members, inform the tutor by **19 Dec 2025**.

2. **Late submission = zero marks**.  
   No excuses (e.g., internet problems).

3. Submit **ONE zip file** named:
StudentID-StudentName.zip
The zip must contain:
- All Java source files (`.java`)
- Resource files (if any)
- UML Class Diagram
- Sequence Diagrams
- Presentation video

4. **Use ONLY Java Swing**.
- ❌ No JavaFX
- ❌ No other frameworks

5. Follow submission instructions given by your tutor.

## 2. Problem Description

The Faculty of Computing and Informatics (FCI) organizes an annual **Postgraduate Academic Research Seminar** for Master’s and PhD students.

This seminar:
- Acts as a mini conference
- Allows students to present research progress
- Provides structured feedback from evaluators

To improve **management and transparency**, FCI requires a **standalone Java Swing–based Seminar Management System**.

### 3.2 Evaluator (Panel Member)
- Reviews assigned presentations
- Provides evaluation using predefined rubrics:
- Problem Clarity
- Methodology
- Results
- Presentation
- Adds comments and marks for each presenter

---

### 3.3 Coordinator (Faculty Staff)
- Creates and manages seminar sessions:
- Date
- Venue
- Session type
- Assigns evaluators and presenters to sessions
- Generates:
- Seminar schedules
- Final evaluation reports

- **Sequence Diagrams**

Key classes should include (but are not limited to):
- User
- Student
- Evaluator
- Coordinator
- Submission
- Session
- Evaluation
- Award
- Report

---

### Part 2: Implementation
- Java Swing application
- All core functionalities implemented
