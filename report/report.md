## Introduction
This lab exercise implements a Java Swing based Seminar Management System that supports students (presenters), evaluators, and coordinators. The objective is to deliver a coherent OO design that aligns UML artifacts with a runnable application, offering clean role-based dashboards, validations, and simple persistence via CSV files.

## Requirements / Features Summary
- **Authentication / Role Selection:** Login by role (Student, Evaluator, Coordinator) with demo credentials.
- **Student Module:** Browse seminars, enroll/register, view enrollment status.
- **Coordinator Module:** Create and update seminar details, monitor participant enrollments.
- **Evaluator Module:** Record rubric scores (problem clarity, methodology, results, presentation) and comments per seminar.
- **Seminar Listing & Details:** Table-based listings with dates, venues, and status.
- **Persistence:** CSV storage under `data/` for users, seminars, enrollments, and evaluations.
- **Validation & Feedback:** Required field checks, informative dialogs, and average score display.

## System Design
- **Use Case Diagram:** Captures the interactions of Student, Evaluator, and Coordinator with core use cases: login, browse, enroll, manage seminars, evaluate presentations, and monitor participants.
- **Class Diagram:** Organized packages (`model`, `repository`, `service`, `ui`, `util`). Key classes include `Seminar`, `Enrollment`, `Evaluation`, `User`, and supporting enums. Services encapsulate business rules and delegate to repositories. UI frames depend on services only, ensuring separation of concerns.
- **Sequence Diagrams:**
  1. Student login and seminar browsing.
  2. Student enrollment flow with persistence.
  3. Coordinator creating/updating seminars.
  4. Evaluator recording/overwriting evaluations and viewing averages.

## Implementation
- **Architecture:** MVC-inspired layering: Swing UI frames -> services -> repositories -> CSV files. IDs generated by `IdGenerator`.
- **UI Screens:**
  - `RoleSelectionFrame` provides role choice and credential entry.
  - `StudentDashboard` lists seminars and allows enrollment with status tracking.
  - `CoordinatorDashboard` offers create/edit seminar dialog and participant table.
  - `EvaluatorDashboard` lets evaluators score seminars using rubric spinners and comments.
- **Persistence:** Simple CSV per entity using `FileUtils`; repositories preload sample users and seminars for immediate demo use.
- **Extensibility Notes:** New roles or statuses can be added via enums and additional dashboards; repositories abstract storage to allow migration to databases.

## Testing / Sample Runs
- Verified launching via `java ui.Main` (after compilation) to navigate each dashboard.
- Sample credential set (seeded): `stu1/pass`, `eval1/pass`, `coord1/pass`.
- Enrollment and evaluation actions persist to CSV and are reloaded on restart.

## Screenshots
Capture the following screens for submission:
1. Login / Role Selection screen.
2. Student dashboard with seminar list and details visible.
3. Student enrollment confirmation and updated enrollment table.
4. Coordinator dashboard showing create/edit seminar dialog.
5. Coordinator participant management table with enrollment rows.
6. Evaluator evaluation form populated and saved with average score.
7. Evidence of persistence after restarting (tables showing saved data).

## Conclusion
The delivered system satisfies the lab requirements with consistent UML and code. Role-based workflows are implemented end-to-end with validations and CSV persistence. The modular design and enums make it straightforward to extend with new seminar statuses, award modules, or additional analytics.

## Presentation Script Outline
1. **Class Diagram (1 min):** Walk through layered packages, entities, and relationships; highlight separation between UI, service, repository, and model.
2. **Sequence Diagrams (1 min):** Narrate student enrollment and evaluator scoring flows to show object interactions.
3. **Implementation Demo (1–2 min):** Show login, seminar browsing, enrollment, coordinator creation, and evaluator scoring.
4. **Design Coherence (30 sec):** Explain how UML names map directly to code and how persistence abstraction eases future enhancements.
